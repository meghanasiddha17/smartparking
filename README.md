The Smart Parking System uses an ESP32 to manage parking spaces efficiently. Buttons simulate RFID tags due to hardware constraints. When pressed, the system checks the ID, opens a servo-controlled gate if authorized, and logs the event to ThingSpeak. Developed on Wokwi, the system demonstrates efficient parking management and real-time monitoring.
